One of TouchBistro's distinguishing features (and one of its biggest strengths), is its unique hybrid architecture. Many of the top restaurant POS systems on the market are strictly cloud-based, which means that when the Internet goes down, all your POS features go down with it.  A hybrid POS system means you get all the capabilities of a cloud POS, but also a hardwired, local connection that can act as a backup if you lose your Internet connection.

TouchBistro generates revenue on a software as a service model (SaaS) with establishments paying a fee for each IPad in use.  Restaurateurs can download the application directly from Apple Inc.’s App store.

**Recommendations**

More integration with other applications/services.

Mayve even offer a delivery service, and/or partner/integrate with a company like UberEATS, and possibly offer or team with TaaS companies.

By doing this it would expand their consumer base

1. Reap the benefits of standardization – consolidate single POS for bigger franchises.  POS can unlock business value, but francisees often push back due to costs, implementation and training time which in my opinion over time will pay off

2. Create stronger omnichannel strategies….whether kiosk or at drive up window…integrate pos with multiple platforms

3. Extend the tailored offers customers want – Targeted recommendations drive loalty among consumers who are accustomed to the digital channel’s abililty to their likes and dislikes and craft offers based on them.  Integrate sensor driven technologies.

4. Spend more time with customers - By easing the long waits and frustration of checkout lines, mobile payments not only make customers happy but they also give your staff the opportunity to connect with customers

5. Develop more fluid, seamless operations – “Integration is the strength of digital POS platforms. With APIs and plug-and-play connectivity, POS can serve as the center of customer-service ecosystems, for example, connecting with third-party platforms such as ride-sharing provider Uber and online delivery apps such as Uber Eats and GrubHub.  It can also link to sensors in connected kitchens to improve operational efficiency and reduce food waste. In kitchens, digital POS can, say, monitor how many French fries have been sold and determine whether to start the fryer.”

6. Be ready for what’s next - Digital is changing POS rapidly – but the greatest advances are still to come. Adding augmented and virtual reality functionality to the point of sale will let marketers offer information in exciting new ways. Loyalty cards, for example, might integrate with AR/VR headsets, enabling high-value customers to view visual promotional offers. Transactions will soon move beyond POS terminals and mobile devices to payment-enabled wearables, connected cars, and smart home devices. A single-platform POS is the first step to your hospitality provider’s payments future.
